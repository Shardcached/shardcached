 * more statistics on work done outside of the worker threads
   (like when shardcache_get()/set() is called from an http thread and
    it involves fetching/sending data from/to a peer)

 * support expiration of keys once ready in libshardcache

 * datapipe fetch requests by serving chunks of data while downloading
   them from a peer ... this would speedup get requests which involve
   fetching the data from a peer.

 * rest storage plugin

 * HTTP interface: handle more received and sent HTTP headers (modification
   times, partial content...)
