 * assign labels to nodes so that they can be used by the hashing function
   instead of their address:port string nodes can change their ip address
   or name (or even the listening port) but still be the same node which
   might be already holding existing keys.

 * support a configuration file
   cmdline arguments will still be supported and will override options
   defined in the configuration file.

 * more statistics on work done outside of the worker threads
   (like when shardcache_get()/set() is called from an http thread and
    it involves fetching/sending data from/to a peer)

 * datapipe fetch requests by serving chunks of data while downloading
   them from a peer ... this would speedup get requests which involve
   fetching the data from a peer.

 * support migration
   instances need to be notified someway of begin/end of a migration and
   be aware of both continua (before and after the migration)
   during this period the instance should move the items not owned anymore,
   use the new continuum for all set requests , use the new continuum for all
   get and delete requests but revert to the old continuum in case those fails
   because of the item not found.
   At the end of a migration the old continuum can be disposed

 * parallelize eviction
   evict commands are very small and can be handled quickly but now it's
   only one thread making this job and it might be not enough in case of
   a big number of delete requests for keys not owned by the
   receiving instance)

 * support expiration of keys

 * mysql storage

 * redis storage
