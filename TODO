 * support mime/types and use them when serving data back to http clients

 * more statistics on work done outside of the worker threads
   (like when shardcache_get()/set() is called from an http thread and
    it involves fetching/sending data from/to a peer)

 * datapipe fetch requests by serving chunks of data while downloading
   them from a peer ... this would speedup get requests which involve
   fetching the data from a peer.

 * support migrations once ready in libshardcache

 * support expiration of keys once ready in libshardcache

 * mysql storage

 * redis storage
