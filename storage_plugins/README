*  Loadable Storage Modules  *

 Storage plugins are expected to export only the two following symbols :

 -- shardcache_storage_t *storage_create(const char **options)
 -- void storage_destroy(shardcache_storage_t *storage)

 storage_create() should return a pointer to a properly initialized
 shardcache_storage_t structure.
 The same pointer will be provided to storage_destroy() in order to release
 all the resources used by the storage module. 

 The **options argument in storage_create() is expcted to be a NULL-terminated
 array of strings containing key/value pairs.

 For example:
 
 char **options = { 
                    "storage_path",         // key
                    "/some/path",           // value
                    "tmp_path",             // key
                    "/some/temporary_path", // value
                    NULL                    // terminator
                  }

 The storage module MUST implement the logic to check the validity of the
 **options array in storage_create() and return a NULL pointer if it's invalid.
